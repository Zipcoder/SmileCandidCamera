what's your favorite cool python feature

Record a video.

1) Decide on what very cool python feature is your favorite.
2) Write about 400-500 word script for a video that shows/demos/describes your favorite python feature.
3) Record a 3-ish minute video with your script, of you showing your favorite python feature.
4) The demo could be of a terminal session, and IDE session, or just a demo of the software in action. Your call.

Post the URL to the video on Slack; we'll have a "movie night in the afternoon", and watch them all together. 
Bring your favorite movie snack.
